Parallax website project is a unique and very nice among the others because of its scrolling like a 3D effect. Also computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. Here i used only properties of HTML & CSS. My implementation results in that webpage are different layers of backgrounds move than the foreground content while scrolling.
